        "The Serengeti National Park is Tanzania's oldest and most celebrated park, spanning 14,763 km² of open savannah, woodland, and riverine forest in the heart of the Serengeti ecosystem. It is the stage for the Great Migration — the largest overland animal movement on Earth — where over 1.5 million wildebeest, 200,000 zebra, and 300,000 Thomson's gazelle follow ancient seasonal circuits in search of fresh pasture and water. The park hosts Africa's highest concentration of large predators, with lion, leopard, cheetah, hyena, and wild dog all regularly sighted by safari vehicles. UNESCO recognised the Serengeti as a World Heritage Site in 1981, and the wider ecosystem — including Kenya's Masai Mara — forms one of the last intact large-mammal migrations on the planet.",

Its labyrinthine streets are lined with centuries-old coral-stone buildings, ornately carved wooden doors studded with brass spikes, and bustling bazaars that testify to Zanzibar's centuries as the dominant commercial hub of the East African coast. Landmarks include the Old Fort (Ngome Kongwe) built by Omani Arabs in 1699, the House of Wonders (Beit el-Ajaib), the former slave market and Anglican Cathedral, and Freddie Mercury's birthplace. The waterfront Forodhani Gardens come alive at sunset with grilled street food stalls drawing locals and visitors alike.
